Work out what how high the SPI baud rate can be, if cable connections are
made really short and tidy.

Expand virtual modules when writing individual LEDs. Presently scroll
wrapping doesn't work reliably when individual LEDs are written,
unless they remain within the physical display size.

Provide a command to set scroll speed (if it can be made fast enough to
be worthwhile)
